Project 4 in the JavaScript 30 course is one without much CSS so I decided to add a little bit of theme to it and implemented a drill sergeant png an army camouflage background and the black ops font from Google Fonts. The project is called Array Cardio so a drill sergeant seemed appropriate to me, but the main part of the project is in the console window as it's all about utilizing Array methods and logging the results.

Here are some screenshots
